# CECS 342 Lab 5: Ancient Languages with Fortran 77

## Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment is to give you some experience programming with older programming languages. You will be using Fortran 77 for this assignment (and not a newer version of Fortran!).

Write a program in Fortran 77 to sort an array of numbers entered from the keyboard and then using binary search, search for a number in the array. If the number is not found then it should ask for another number. The program should work in a loop to search for multiple numbers one by one without having to execute the program again. Your program must use the 77 standard of Fortran--you may not use a later version of Fortran to complete this assignment (eg. Fortran 95).

[A good reference (probably one of the only remaining) on Fortran 77 can be found here](http://www-mdp.eng.cam.ac.uk/web/CD/engapps/programming/fortran/prof77.pdf). The file has also been included in the repository [here](docs/prof77.pdf).

## Deliverables

Submit the following items through your git repository:
* Your `.f` source code (some compilers use `*.f77` as the file extension, which is also fine)
* A screenshot of a sample run and output of your program
* A `*.txt` file with a writeup about your experiences with Fortran 77.
  
Your submission must follow the following rules, *else I will not grade it and you will receive a zero for the submission*:

* Do not use compression on your files
* Make sure that all significant code is *commented* with your own explanations
